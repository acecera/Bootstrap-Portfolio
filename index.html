                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <img src="assets/images/filler.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Anthony Cera">
                <p>My name is Anthony, I'm 26 years old. I was born in Panorama City 
                    and raised in Burbank where I currently reside. When I'm not working as 
                    a chef to pay for school, I usually start my day off with a lite breakfast
                    of toast or an acai bowl/fruit bowl. Then I go to the gym for about an hour,
                    after which I usually like to run any errands I need to do before I start on 
                    studying and working on HW or assignments.</p>
                <p>My hobbies include music, I play the guitar, bass, drums, keyboard and sing. I love 
                   to eat and try new food or restaurants. I love to snowboard during the winter season, 
                   usually I go up to Bear/Summit Mountain if it's just for a day or Mammoth if I'm able 
                   to make a weekend out of it. Some of my other hobbies include wathcing movies either at 
                   the theatre or at home. I enjoy playing video games with my brother and friends and just
                   hanging out with friends and family as much as I can.</p>
